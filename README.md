# tests api with cypress


## Pre-requirements

It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

> I used versions `v20.11.1` and `10.2.4` of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

## Installation

Run `npm install` (or `npm i` for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

## Tests

run `npm run test` to open Cypress in interactive mode.
